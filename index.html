                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hello World! Pj Dev here and words on street, he's a talkative. I'll try to be less talkative here as quick as possible. At the time of writing (<time datetime="21:28pm 21/10/2024">21:28pm 21/10/2024</time>), It's been two month now since the first idea of the theory. The Theory we're all here for might be silly and awkward to hear and might bring pain and bad memories some of which are good if we reframe our perspective (some of the hardest thing on earth), but trust me it will worth our time. </p>
                <p>Long time ago, someone sat under a tree and got inspired by an apple falling down. Here i'll stop the story. We all know it. If we're being observative we'll realise that <strong>Sir. Isaac Newton</strong> connected the dot. Famous scientist before and after him connected the dots. Including what we all tend to do daily. Most of the time, all are linked together. Or all the time? </p>
                <p>It's been two month now since the first idea of the theory. The creator got ideas from Schrodinger's Famous Though Experiment - The Schrodinger's Cat. It's something we all knew of, but if we had no idea what it was or just want to refresh our idea on the theory, here's what might help. </p>
                <p>After much pondering, he realize one thing that is certain! Uncertaintity. To think of the future, most of the time we ignore our states. Are we sleeping? Are we feeling fatigue? Are we up to the task? Are we healthy? Most of the time, no! We only told ourselves, tomorrow i will visit the coffee shop by 5pm. We never considered, what if our boss called us that there's a work to be done by this exactly 5pm? Only then do we realize that, there are alot of unconsidered variable when we make the decision that 'tomorrow i'll visit the coffee shop by 5pm'. </p>
                <p>This leads to the theory of life. Yes, this life that make us alive. </p>
                <p>A quick note from the owner is that, this theory is about you! And it has alot of benefit for you and the owner said he has no guarantee this will be of help or is accurate whatsoever, everyone has an opinion and most of the people he has shown this theory belives it was somehow accurate. No one knows tomorrow, they says. </p>

                <h2>The Theory</h2>
                <p>Ha! I talked too much again! I should be more focused on why we're here. Why? We're here because of the theory. The Proposed <strong>Theory Of Life</strong>.</p>
                <p>The theory state as below:</p>
                <blockquote><q>For every next minute of living, there's a 50% chance of alive and a 50% chance of dead. Hence, we don't really know except we're already at 'that' next minute and the cycles goes on. </q></blockquote>
                <p>First of all, this sounds ridiculous and i'll try my best to explain it clearly. </p>
                <p>We're currently in the present, no matter where you are, what is going on when you're reading this, that' which is going on and the current time you reading this is called the <b>Present</b>. 
                    Then we have the nightmare most of us run from or wish we run towards to (we'll always run away from)... And that is the past. It's what is once current but now is not current anymore. In other words, our past is once the present. Then we have the third, which leads to this rather absurd theory.
                </p>
                <p>The Future - We can speculate on the future how we like, but that that later happens is the future rather than what we speculate. It is actually good to have an idea of what future awaits one, but no matter what the idea is... It is still your speculation which can be real and sometimes not. Sometimes it is just our mere illusion that overrides the present moment, not letting you stay in the present and obsessing over a speculation. Pardon me, i had no idea what i was speaking about and to be frank, i've digress from the original topic. </p>
                <p>The future is that which never exists. The past and present do, but the future doesn't. Let me be specific and ask you a question, 10 minute ago is your past? 10 minute later from 10 minute ago, was now right? 10 minute later was your future, right? </p>
                <p>If your answers from above question was right, then i also agree with you. But you have an idea of two things, while the other is just you in the present in some time later. Imagine this, we can talk about your past "YOU", because it exists. We can talk about the present you, because well, there you are but we got a stop when we get to the future. Why? Because we can never know. And in our analogy earlier, let's say 10 minute later we ask where are you... Your answer will be 'in the present'. Why not in the future? You are here presently. To think of the future is to think of you in the present in some later time. </p>
                <p>If you still don't get the analogy, let's say i owe you money and you wanted to collect it tomorrow, when it is tomorrow... What did you say? I'm going to collect my money from him today. Why today, why not tomorrow? You can never leave the present and jump to tomorrow... You will always be in the present, and have an idea of your past but for that of the future, nothing! </p>
                <p>I'm so sorry i still digress from the main topic but you get the idea, we are always in the present. The question then is, what has this got to do with this absurd theory? </p>
                <p>The future is real but in that same future, there is alot of Uncertaintity that then leads to the former statement of the theory. </p>
                <blockquote><q>For every next minute of living, there's a 50% chance of alive and a 50% chance of dead. Hence, we don't really know except we're already at 'that' next minute and the cycles goes on. </q></blockquote>
                <p>By now i believe we all understood what the theory means... While that of the future is unknown we can still predict alot on the future but what this theory stands on was that which was stated in the theory. </p>
                <p>Let's move on to latest update on the theory.</p>

                <h2>The Theory Background</h2>
                <p>The Theory of Life originates from the famous Schrodinger's thougt experiment, that which is known as "The Schrodinger's Cat thought experiment". </p>
                <p>The experiment has to do with a Cat's survival which is 50/50 chance. There's a 50% chance the cat will survive in the box and there's another 50% chance it will not. </p>
                <p>If you're completely new to the theory i'ld recommend learning more about the Schrodinger's Cat thought experiment. As it'll be of extremely important to navigating and truly understanding the Theory of Life and what it stoods for. </p>
                <p>Few months back, the creator of the proposed Theory was probably just pondering over the famous thought experiment... And he starts to wonder if there are some hidden gem underneath the thought experiment. But when he realized the box, how one can only find the truth if one opens the box... It clicked. </p> 
                <p>Instead of seeing a thought experiment, he saw an analogy of a newly created (Proposed) theory. The theory will have to be described and has to make a sense in one way or the other. The box is a mystery, so was our future. It's just unknown to us whether we'll be alive or dead, just like the cat. Putting one or two things together and making some adjustments based on people's feedback, He can finally said that this proposed theory does have a future. </p>
                <p>The theory was greatly inspired by the schrodingers cat. In it's simplest form of analogy... Few questions are proposed. i) What if our future self is that in the box. But we don't just have one box, there are infinite number of boxes. But in each boxes we can be alive or dead, and we're traveling linearly along the box. Opening each one of the box as the present unravels. Hence we're aware of our current state. The state can only be two. It's either you're dead or alive. There are no other states. In our current world, you might thought we have other states e.g I'm so alive, I'm alive but i'm feeling great pain, Or I feel like a dead. First of all, the above list proves that you're alive. You should be grateful for that.
                </p>
                <p>Why should you be grateful for that? Well, when experimenting with the theory we've come to a conclusion that best describes the analogy than a cat in a black box. Imagine a light bulb, the one our live met before coming back to us. If the light bulb is on, it means it should continue it's process. When it is off, it means it's time to leave the body. And this light bulb has a 50% chance of being off or on for every next minute. </p>
                <p>But that still doesn't explain why we should be grateful. Listen to this, the light bulb doesn't have more chance of being on for you or being off for you. What'd i meant by this? Let's say i'm sick and on the verge of death, the light bulb doesn't have more percentage of being off to me... It's still 50% and 50%. In other words it remain constant. </p>
                <p>You should be grateful for it because it could turn of any minute from now and it hasn't. That same time you're reading this, this light bulb has turned off to many lives that it was also previously On. It is wrong to think that you being alive is because you don't ate junk food, you're a vegetarian, you practice yoga every minute... or whatever it is that you do... This is what you do and you do it in preparating for the day it turns off. No matter what you do, you're not moving backward to the day it turn off, you're moving forward to the day it turns off. </p>
                <p>So why should you be grateful? You're alive! Be grateful. But i'm alive because of this or that... That is a wrong way of thinking, you're not alive based on what you do or don't do, you're alive simply because in that present moment you're alive. And no matter what you do in order to prevent the inevitable for happening, it'll happen when it's time for every one of us light bulb to went off. </p>
                <p>In this section, i believed i've clarified the background of this theory using the schrodinger's cat as it's base and the simple analogy of the light bulb. </p>

                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <p>Below are the common <em>FAQ</em>: </p>
                <section>
                    <details>
                        <summary>What are the benefit of this theory? Why was it created (proposed) in the first place? </summary>
                        <p>The theory has a lot of what i'ld like to call "Advantage" or "Pros"... They include but not limited to:
                            <dl>
                                <dt>#1</dt>
                                <dd><p> It let us live in the present moment. What does that mean? It means we only have one moment in life. We don't have the past for it is gone. We don't have the future for it is yet to come. But what do we have to live for? The Present. </p>
                                <p>This also leads us to being grateful of what we have. The present. And stop worrying about the past for it is gone. Or worrying about our mere speculation which is the future. </p>
                                <p>Living in the present might sounds great but it does have it's own shortcome. But imagine wasting that present moment, focusing on not it (the present), but on what it's gone or what it's yet to come.</p>
                                <p>As of writing, a book title comes to my mind "Your Future Starts Now". Which obviously decipate the illusion masses have over the future. You ask yourself, what did i want to do now? Maybe eat. Or maybe i'll eat in the next few minutes. Well, what's wrong with eating now... You're discussing about the next few minutes that have a 50% chance of caming into your existence or otherwise. </p>
                                <p>Living in the present moment let us cherish it, care for it, make thoughtful decision or choice - the one that will benefit us in the long run. </p>
                                <p>But here comes the weird part, if you only think about the present how do you make plans for your goals yet to come? Simple! You make plans just as normal, but also keep in mind it's not static yet. It hasn't happened. What you said you'll do in the next 5 days, you'll have to wait for the next 5 days before doing it... and live those moment (the next 5 days) presently rather than speculating or creating illusions of how you'll execute what you'll execute in the next 5 days. </p>
                            </dd>
                            <dt>#2</dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p>It leads to a peaceful coexistence. Imagine this, this moment might be the last moment of your life. So, ask yourself, if it was will i still be here with a gun in my hand hunting someone because of vengeance? Or will i be out here smoking marijuana? Ask deeply. If this moment is the last, is this how you'll spent it?</p> 
                                <p>This might sound controversial, but think deeply about it... For starters, i used to think i have no heart, hence no love or hate... but thinking about this made me realize i wouldn't want to spend my last minute worrying about anything but instead doing the most right thing to do in that present moment. You also soon realize the most right thing to do has nothing to with inflicting pain for others, or raping someone, or burning the world. </p>
                                <p>If you think and think and nothing sort of peace came up, you're not thinking deeply. Not reaching the bottom of yourself. Deep down if it's really inevitable that next moment we'll be dead, we'll be at peace with others. </p>
                                <p></p>
                            </dd>
                            <dt>#3</dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p>It leads to <strong>Dettachment</strong>. I'm sort of a Buddhist guy. But we're not going down that road here. Dettachment in short means letting go. Letting go of the idea that the next minute is sure for you to be alive. </p>
                                <p>Seriously? Yeah. If you do think about letting go of the basic idea that you'll certainly be alive the next minute, the dettachment follows. The dettachment of possession, the dettachment of all; Imagine this, you'll die in less than 60seconds. You'll realize dettachment naturally follows. You stopped thinking of that certificate hung up in the room. You stopped basically attaching yourself to outside things. You're definitely going to spend the rest 59 seconds living as if you own nothing in life. Not even your house or car. </p>
                                <p>But what exactly is the benefit here? It leads to a world where people are not to attached with their possessions to the extent that they don't care about others in other to not loose that thing they're attached to. In reality, not only are they inflicting pain to others but themselves because one person hurt intentionally is you thinking about whether he/she will revenge in the future. </p>
